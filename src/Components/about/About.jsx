            Hi, my name is Aim√©e and I currently reside in Regina, Saskatchewan.
            I graduated from BCIT's New Media Design and Web Development diploma
            program August, 2021. When I am not coding or designing, you can
            find me at the gym working out, travelling, singing, or playing
            video games.
          </p>
          <p className="about__text">
            Within the last year, I have learned so much working at Fellow.
            Throughout my time with the company, I utilized PHP, JavaScript,
            SASS, HTML, TypeScript, WordPress, and React daily. In my
            day-to-day, I was developing custom pages, Gutenberg blocks, and
            altering existing code. I had the great experience of being the
            marketing site's sole developer at Fellow. Because of this, my
            communication and organization skills greatly improved. It allowed
            me to build a solid foundation for my development process and
            enhanced my problem-solving skills.
          </p>
          <p className="about__text">
            I am currently looking for my next role and am open to any
            opportunities in front end! I look forward to my next new adventure,
            and can't wait to continue improving every day.
